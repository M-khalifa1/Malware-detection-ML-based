# Shannon-entropy-in-malware-detection-based-on-ML
Some Automated malware analysis depends on Shannon entropy as a feature in the machine learning model to distinguish between malicious files and legitimate files.

Shannon entropy: is a mathematical equation used to measure the randomness of data in the file. Based on the percentage of entropy, we can predict whether the file is malicious or not,

Some malware authors use the following techniques to evade detection using entropy:

1-you can do XOR operation with a single character to part of encrypted malware to reduce the entropy, as demonstrated in the code.

2-add normal data like strings in the malware to reduce the entropy.

3-encrypt part of the malware, such as 20% of malware.
